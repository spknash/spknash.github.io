Hello, I'm Suhaas. I love building interesting new applications. Technologies and topics I am interested in include machine learning, deep learning, and system design. I am currently a student at the University of Chicago. As of June, 2023 I will be sharing all new projects and applications I build on this site. I'll also share the things I learn along the way. Please reach out if you are interested in collaborating on a project!
