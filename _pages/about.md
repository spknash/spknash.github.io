I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, majoring in computer science and minoring in mathematics. I am broadly interested in problem solving, algorithmic research and complex software systems development. In the past I have done internships at such companies as Pegasystems, PayPal and MITRE Corp. I have also done research assistanships at: University of Chicago, WPI and Dartmouth College.   

My current academic interest is Deep Learning and its usage in human-centered applications. As I learn more about Deep Learning and implement some of concepts into practical projects, thought of sharing ideas through these pages.
