## Motivation

Hello there! this is my first post. My motivation for writing here is to document my learning in the topics I am interested in (ML/DL, system design, math, programming, tech, etc.). I have always been very interested in how individuals continue to learn and improve their craft. I thought Jeremy Howards thoughts on how to learn are very insightful. He believes that practical application of a new concept is a more valuable first step than trying to understand all the foundational underpinnings. I tend to agree with that sentiment. Despite having so much information about how to learn, and how to improve I feel like there are still so many questions that are left unanswered. If youâ€™re trying to learn more about Deep learning, what did you do each week? How did your view/understanding of a topic change as you went deeper into it? I am interested in these types of questions and by documenting my learning and improvement starting from the level of a beginner in many ways, I will leave behind a record of what I did, and how it helped me learn. This record will be really interesting for me to look back on, and hopefully it can help someone else too.
