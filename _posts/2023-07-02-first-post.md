## Motivation

Hello there! this is my first post. My motivation for writing here is to document my learning in the topics I am interested in (ML/DL, system design, math, programming, tech, etc.). I have always been very interested in how individuals continue to learn and improve their craft. I thought Jeremy Howards thoughts on how to learn are very insightful. He believes that practical application of a new concept is a more valuable first step than trying to understand all the foundational underpinnings. I tend to agree with that sentiment.
