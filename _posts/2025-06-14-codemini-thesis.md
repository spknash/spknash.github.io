We believe that the best way to learn is through hands-on learning. This belief is at odds with the way most K-12, MOOCs, and even higher education institutions approach learning.
The vast majority of these learning institutions have students follow the lecture-plus-problem-set rut. In the traditional mode of instruction students are expected to consume some learning material and are then evaluated on their retention.

There is a mountain of evidence showing that active learning is the biggest accelerator for students <sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#3">3</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#4">4</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#5">5</a>]</sup>. Despite this, most institutions still follow the traditional model. Why is this? The biggest roadblock is the time and energy required to create a hands-on project that is challenging, yet still providing enough guidance for the student to complete it. At universities, professors and teacher assistants pour hundreds of hours into making such projects. 

The recent advancements of LLM powered coding agents make it possible to quickly generate hands-on software projects. Tell Codemini "I want to learn about databases and Rust". Our MVP will generate an engaging hands-on project complete with skeleton code, automated tests, and a detailed editorial so students can create a Rust backed database with instant feedback and support. 

Many companies are already trying to do course generation using LLMs. This already works pretty well. We are looking one step ahead and trying to generate hands-on projects. Our core technological moat will be the QA cycle which allows a student to create and refine their own hands-on project. This cycle iteratively generates and solves projects, snuffing out bugs and hallucinations in each round.
