I want to create a profile picture for myself using stable diffusion. I've seen people online such as Abhishek Thakur and Max Howell use AI-generated profile pictures. The good ones which I've seen make the photo more interesting but preserve the subject's core facial features. Below are some that I really like.

To create my own profile picture the first thing I did was do some research into what models are used to create these images. The most popular opensource models are the diffusion models released by Stability AI[link] and runway ML[link]. The most recent of which is Stable Diffusion 3. Their older model Stable Diffusion XL is still being updated by the opensource community and still considered the SOTA model by most.
